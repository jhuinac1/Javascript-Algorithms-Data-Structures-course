# Doubly Linked List
Almost identical to Singly Linked Lists, except every node has another pointer, to the previous ndoe!

Better than Singly Linked Lists for finding nodes and can be done in falf the time!

However, They do take up more memory considering the extra pointer.


### The drawback
It uses more memory, in order to be more flexible.
it's almost always a tradeoff.



## Big O

- insertion - O(1)
- Removal - O(1);
- searching - O(N)
- Access - O (N)

Technically searching is O(N/2), but that's still O(N).
